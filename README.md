# gpio-wasm-components

This repository serves as the home for the proof of concept developed as part of my Master's thesis research.
Unfortunately I did not have the time YET to clean up the code. The code needs to be available for my thesis defense.
It is filled with quick hacks for the benchmarks.

Note: the host impl is not using the parameters from the guest, my latest benchmarking checks if the canonical ABI was lifting the parameters.
But setting these back is straight forward.
